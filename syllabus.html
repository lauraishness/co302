					<div class="col-sm-6">
						

						<p>CO302, like other 300-level composition courses, emphasizes writing processes with specific attention to revising and editing, and critical reading processes with attention to reading from various points of view. We diverge from other 300-level courses with our emphasis on experiencing and producing primarily <strong>digital texts.</strong></p>

						<p>To achieve this, you will explore the rhetorical and cultural contexts in which electronic texts occur, and practice strategies for interpreting and producing these texts. You need not be (and will not become) expert designers and coders in this course, as these are professions in their own right that one 16-week course cannot equip you for; however, my hope is that you <strong>develop technical literacies</strong> and <strong>rhetorical competencies</strong> that help you navigate a world where information and ideas are shared and produced in online, digital contexts.</p>

									<p>In order to compose, we will learn some basic literacies with HTML/CSS, photo editing, document design, and other technologies; however, I encourage you to self-advocate and experiment with mediums that interest you, knowing that your technical competency is not the primary learning outcome or evaluative criteria. Use the instigators, the homework, and the larger projects as "sand-box" type projects as far as medium and technology goes.

										</ul>
									</p>
							
									<p>Know that your success in this course depends on your ability to <strong>employ rhetorical strategies</strong>, think <strong>deeply & critically</strong>, and put forth a <strong>genuine effort</strong> to learn something new that excites <em>you</em>; you are not evaluated on your ability to become completely literate in the mediums or technologies you choose to use. Rather, we will learn to think rhetorically about the technologies & texts we encounter and use.</p>

								<p>You’ll receive an assignment guide with each major assignment that I’ll use to assess the project. Generally, each assignment is assessed using the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DWvVBP5AxfRrm5mpfJbfjbEhWzeewXi5/view?usp=sharing"><u>hierarchy of rhetorical concerns</u></a>. Carefully prepare & proofread your final draft submissions. Make sure each submission is given a file name that suites your audience (i.e. “comphw.docx” is too vague). <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_formatting_and_style_guide.html"><u>MLA citation format</u></a> must be used for all applicable assignments. </p>

								<h4>Due Dates</h4>
									<p>Deadlines mean that major assignments must be submitted to Canvas or sent to me by email by the designated time (on the assignment sheet or canvas) on the due date. I do not accept late major assignments for full credit (half a letter grade is deducted every 24 hours the project is late); because of a large course load with many students, I cannot accept late process work (homework, workshop drafts, smaller assignments) at all. <strong>Major assignments submitted more than 5 days after the due date will not be accepted.</strong></p>
									<p>Due dates for homework, instigators, and other smaller assignments will be announced in class or via canvas or the course schedules. You are responsible for keeping track of all due dates for the course. Do reach out, though, if you are ever confused about a due date; not knowing a due date (or confusion about a due date) does not override the due date. Please self-advocate and stay on top of assignments by using the many course resources at your disposal.</p>
								<h4>Extensions & Extenuating Circumstances</h4>
									<p>In general, I do not grant exceptions to late work in retrospect; however, if you have an extenuating circumstance arise that interferes with your ability to do your best work on a major assignment, I will consider an extension if you <strong>contact me via email in advance of the due date</strong>. Requests for extensions after a due date has passed will not be granted. These extensions apply to major projects; unfortunately I do not have the capacity to provide extensions for homework, workshops, instigators, or other smaller assignments.</p>
								<h4>Expectation of Workload</h4>
									<p>Please keep in mind that the University expects homework or other work outside of instructional time to be equivalent to the federal credit hour definition of at least 2 hours of outside work for each contact hour.</p>
								
								<h4>Grade Breakdown</h4>
									<div class="post-thumbnail">
										<img src="assets/images/grades.png" alt=""></a>
									</div>
							
								<p>The final grade is determined and reported to the university through the campus grading portal -- the grade in Canvas will give you a general impression of your final grade, but know that extra credit, excessive absences, late work, consistent disengagement in class, or unsubmitted major projects may affect your final, official course grade; therefore, Canvas may not be a precisely accurate representation of your final course grade. I am always happy to discuss your grade with you and ways to improve for the next project; however, grades are non-negotiable. </p>
								
								<h4>Final Grade Scale</h4>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>A+</strong> 100% to 96.67%</li>
									<li><strong>A</strong> < 96.67% to 93.33%</li>
									<li><strong>A-</strong> < 93.33% to 90%</li>
									<li><strong>B+</strong> < 90% to 86.67%</li>
									<li><strong>B</strong> < 86.67% to 83.33%</li>
									<li><strong>B-</strong> < 83.33% to 80%</li>
									<li><strong>C+</strong> < 80% to 76.67%</li>
									<li><strong>C</strong> < 76.67% to 70%</li>
									<li><strong>D-</strong> < 70% to 60%</li>
									<li><strong>F</strong> < 60% to 0%</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Note that CSU does not allow for a C-, D+, D-, or F+ as final grades. <strong>Also note: </strong>Absences can override satisfactory completion of coursework. See the attendance policy below.

									<p><strong>Instigators are written or multi-modal responses to the readings. What did the reading make you do or think? What's one way to apply the reading? What's your critique or reaction to the reading? </strong>Instigators give you a chance to apply and react to the texts that we're reading in this course -- they might also help form our course discussions on Wednesdays.</p>

									<p>I'm hesitant to put any parameters on these -- because I want you to dig deep and be creative. Instigators are also a chance to use a medium you don't normally use, to practice creating online content, and to think about the implications of the ideas we're exploring in the course. </p>

									<p>My only stipulations: </p>
										<ul>
											<li> Each instigator response should reflect genuine effort / tie back to the readings in some way; synthesize direct quotations or paraphrases (attribute!!) in your responses. </li>
											<li> See <a href="resources.html">Course resources for a few examples (I'll be adding to this list)</a> </li>
											<li>Contain 1-2 questions that you want us to discuss in class</li>
											<li>Complete 6 of the 12 (3 of which MUST be multimodal responses, i.e., not just a text-based answer) </li>
											<li>Must be emailed to the professor (laura.price@colostate.edu) by Wednesday at 9am for MWF or Tuesday by 8am for TTh section. Late submissions will not be considered. </li>

										</ul>
									<p>Remember that these instigators are worth 18% of your grade; there will be 12 opportunities for instigators -- you must complete 6, and you may complete up to 2 additional for extra credit. </p>

									<p>3 of these instigators must use a digital medium other than a simple essay format (meaning you may make a blog post, a podcast, a youtube video, a Photo-essay, a post on social media, a flyer/poster, etc. etc.) Your instigator should also contain 1-2 questions about the readings that you’d like to pose to the class. At the beginning of our Wednesday discussion, we will take a poll on which questions we want to focus on for the discussion. </p>

									<p><strong>Each instigator is worth up to 30 pts.</strong> Occasionally, bonus points are granted for exceptional execution, creativity, or depth of thought. </p>

									<p>Worth: Cumulative and Combined with Workshops</p>
									<p>Course work is a broad category that might consist of (1) your in-class writings (prepared and shared in Google Docs at various points) (2) informal group activities (3) Wednesday discussions about readings or (4) Participation in technology workshops on Fridays.
									<p>Classwork is cumulative and reflects your engagement with the readings, the discussions & group activities in the course throughout the semester. As long as you are doing the readings and participating in class (either through the in-class writings or discussions/group work), you should do well here. However, factors like consistent absence, disengagement in class, or frequently not reading the assigned readings will lower this grade. </p>
										<ul>
 											<li>A+ (96+) Superior participation</li>

 											<li>A (93-96) Excellent participation </li>

 											<li>A- (90-93) Very good participation </li>

 											<li>B+ ( 86-90) Good participation</li>

									Occasionally, I will offer opportunities for extra credit to make up lost points on other assignments; as I do not "round" grades at the end of the semester, keep an eye out for these opportunities that might "bump up" a grade at the end of the semester. Do not rely on extra credit to save a low grade, but extra credit can often (though not always) make a difference when your grade is on the edge of a higher grade.

								<p>Therefore, when you are not present in class, you cannot participate in required class discussion, workshops, group work, and assignments. According to the CSU General Catalog, “Students should attend all classes for which they are registered to obtain maximum educational benefits. Absence or lateness does not excuse students from required course work.”</p>

								<p><strong>Your attendance is crucial to your success in this course and contributes to the learning environment</strong>. Missing class often means you'll miss out on important instructions for major assignments, and on graded in-class discussions & writings.  If you know you will be absent, you should plan to submit your work early. If you have an extenuating circumstance, you should speak with me in a timely fashion.</p>

								<p>If you are absent, you cannot make up any in-class work we did that day (e.g. group work,  discussion, quizzes, in-class writing activities, workshop, etc.) unless you make prior arrangements by contacting me via email at least 1 week in advance.</p>

								<h4>Extenuating Circumstances / Student Case Management</h4>
								<p>If you encounter circumstances that cause your missing a significant amount of class (severe illness resulting in hospitalization, death or severe illness in your immediate family, psychological trauma, etc.) please reach out to Student Case Management and Conflict Services—they provide services to help mediate difficult semesters and can work with your instructors to find accommodations (such as extensions, etc.). IMPORTANT: Without a letter from Student Case Management, however, I am not permitted to provide accommodations.</p>

								<h4>Religious Observances and University-Sanctioned Events</h4>
								<p>Absences will be excused for university-sanctioned events and religious holidays or observances only. If you are participating in university-sanctioned events and religious holidays or observances, you must provide appropriate university documentation in advance. If you anticipate missing class due to a religious holiday or religious observance, you are responsible for completing the university’s Religious Accommodation Request Form  at the beginning of each semester. The Composition Program highly recommends that you read the university’s processes and policies for university-sanctioned absences if you are participating in university-sanctioned activities and religious holidays or observances.</p>
								
								<h4>Tardiness</h4>
								<p>Be on time and prepared for class each day. Entering late harms our classroom community by interrupting class, distracting your peers and instructor from the learning process, and causing you to miss important information. If you are late to class and miss handing in in-class writing, or similar activity, you cannot make it up.  Also, please do not leave early or start packing up before class is over. Consistently arriving late/leaving early may constitute an absence. </p>
								<p>In the event of special circumstances (one-time appointment that runs late, important exam WAY across campus, job interview, need to catch a flight, etc.) please just email me and let me know or let me know at the beginning of class that you'll need to duck out.

								<h4>Technology in the Classroom</h4>
								<p>As this is a course about Writing in Digital Environments, you are encouraged to use technology in our course! Please do hold each other accountable for the use of technology in the classroom. Cell phones and other devices might prove useful for coursework, but they can also distract you, me, and your peers. If you’re using your phone/computer for activities other than coursework, I reserve the right to mark down course work grades or count the disengagement as an absence.

								<p>Please be considerate and silence your ringer and refrain from texting/derping (derping, defined as as browsing the internet/sending or replying to snaps/instagramming/reading reddit/yik yaking, whatsapping, etc. or any other activity that distracts you from your embodied [mental and physical] presence in our classroom community)on your phone in class. <strong>I do not mind if you politely excuse yourself should you have a communication need</strong> in the case of an emergency or any pressing academic, family, or professional matter. (This includes BOTH texting and calls.) </p>
								
								<p>Please respect and return any university-owned laptop at the end of class, should you decide to use one of the lab computers.</p>

								<h4>Accommodations</h4>
								<p>Any student eligible for academic adjustments because of a learning disability or medical condition should contact the Student Disability Center at (970) 491-6385 for development of appropriate accommodations.  Note that without proper paperwork from SDC, I cannot give accommodations on assignments, in-class work, or projects.</p>
								<p>Please reach out during office hours to let me know of any SDC letters for accommodations and to discuss how I can best provide accommodate you.</p>
								
								<h4>Title IX Reporting and Resources</h4>
								<p>CSU’s Student Sexual Harassment and Violence policy, following national guidance from the Office of Civil Rights, requires that faculty follow CSU policy as a “mandatory reporter” of any personal disclosure of sexual harassment, abuse, and/or violence related experiences or incidents shared with the faculty member in person, via email, and/or in classroom papers or homework exercises. These disclosures include but are not limited to reports of personal relational abuse, relational/domestic violence, and stalking. While faculty are often able to help students locate appropriate channels of assistance on campus (e.g., see the CSU Health Network link below), disclosure by the student to the faculty member requires that the faculty member inform appropriate CSU channels to help ensure that the student’s safety and welfare is being addressed, even if the student requests that the disclosure not be shared. 

								<p>For counseling support and assistance, please see the CSU Health Network, which includes a variety of counseling services that can be accessed at: http://www.health.colostate.edu/.  And, the Sexual Assault Victim Assistance Team is a confidential student resource that does not have a reporting requirement and that can be of great help to students who have experienced sexual assault. The web address is http://www.wgac.colostate.edu/need-help-support.</p>
							
								<h4>Student Case Management</h4>
								<p>From SCS Mission Statement: "Student Case Management & Referral Coordination provides crisis prevention and intervention services. In difficult situations such as medical, mental health, behavioral, personal or family crisis, illness or injury, a student may find it difficult to navigate the resources and services available. Student Case Managers consult with students, faculty, staff, families, and providers to offer guidance on the next best steps."</p>
								<p>I speak from experience: Life doesn't always play fair, and I encountered my (un)fair share of crises as a student; please don't hesitate to reach out to resources like <a href ="http://www.studentcasemanagement.colostate.edu/"><u>Student Case Management</u></a> if you find yourself in a difficult personal situation this semester. Your Ramily is here to help.</p>
								<h4>CSU Writing Center</h4>
								<p><a href="https://writingcenter.colostate.edu/"><u>The Writing Center</u></a> is located in Eddy 23 and evening consultations in Morgan Library.  It is a free service that provides feedback for all writers at all stages of the writing process.  Check their website for details about the services provided or to schedule an appointment (walk-ins are welcome, though!)  http://writingcenter.colostate.edu/services.html

								<p>CO302 is not an easy class, nor should it be. The skills you learn in this class will prepare you for the critical reading, writing, and thinking skills you will need for writing professionally outside of the university context. It is meant to push you intellectually and will require significant effort on your part.</p>  
								<p>Your decision to remain in this section of CO302 demonstrates your agreement to the policies stated above and also demonstrates your willingness to make a commitment to the class and to your writing.  </p>

								<p>As your instructor, I also make a commitment to this class and my students, and am here to help. I will help you understand how your projects and thinking can improve and then provide suggestions.
